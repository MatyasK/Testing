HOWTO TO START CREATING A JUNIT TEST IN INTELLIJ IDEA
=====================================================

0.  Make sure the project to be tested is already open.

1.  o Open the class for which you want to create a unit test
    o Place the cursor on the line declaring the class (e.g. public class Animal { ...)
    o Open the intened actions menu with shortcut alt-enter (both for Windows and Mac)
    o Here you can select "create test" option
    o A dialog will appear in which you can select the test library. Which is JUNIT4.
      Also you can specify for which methods in the class under test, corresponding test methods should be generated.

2.  You can repeat step 1 for al the classes you will need unit test classes for.

HOWTO TO START CREATING A JUNIT TEST IN ECLIPSE
===============================================

0.  Make sure the project to be tested is already open.

1.  o Create a new project e.g. xxxTest
	o Select: use the "default JRE"
    o In the next window: "New Java Project",
	    select the "Projects" tab
	o Then add the project to be tested to the working set

2.  Repeat as needed:
    Open your new project and create a new JUnit Test Case
	o At the top make sure it will be a version 4 test
	o Give the test a name, e.g. xxxTest.java
	o Select the class to be tested from the other project
	o In the next window select which methods will be tested
	  This will generate a basic set of testcases

	The first time you do this in the new project
	eclipse will offer to add JUnit to the build path;
	Accept this offer.

The first time you run a testcase
you have to select the preferred launcher;
In this case select the Eclipse JUnit Launcher.

WARNING:
If you have a test-method selected, i.e. your cursor
is inside that method, running the test will create
a launcher for that method only!
So either make sure the cursor is positioned
between methods, or select the file in the
package explorer list on the left.
